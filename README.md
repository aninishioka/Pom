A minimalist and easy-to-access time management tool that uses the Pomodoro Technique to help you stay on task. The timer is set to the traditional 25-minute work session followed by a long 15-minute break every 4th cycle or a short 5-minute break at all other intervals. Using the tool is easyâ€”click on the Pom icon to the right of the Chrome navigation bar to display the extension pop-up and hit the start button! Pom is not yet available on the chrome store as it is still in development.
